This is a simple C program that simulates the movement of a rover on a matrix, with the goal of reaching a destination point. The program initializes a matrix with dimensions of 8x8 and places the rover and the destination in specific locations. The rover can move to the right and left within the boundaries of the matrix.

Prerequisites
To run this program, you need a C compiler installed on your computer, such as GCC or Clang.

How to use
